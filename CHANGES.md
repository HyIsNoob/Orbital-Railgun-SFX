# Changes Made to Orbital Railgun Sounds

## Summary
This document describes the changes made to fix the PlayerAreaListener logic, fix logger setup issues, and properly integrate area tracking into the sound system.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Logger Setup Problem
**Issue**: The mod was using `java.util.logging.Logger` instead of SLF4J, which is the standard logging framework for Fabric/Minecraft mods. This caused logs to not appear in the server console even when debug mode was enabled.

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `java.util.logging.Logger` to `org.slf4j.Logger` and `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`
- Updated all logger calls to use SLF4J methods (`info()`, `warn()`, `debug()`)
- Used parameterized logging (e.g., `LOGGER.info("Player {} entered", name)`) for better performance

**Files Changed**:
- `OrbitalRailgunSounds.java`: Changed logger initialization and updated `warning()` to `warn()`
- `SoundLogger.java`: Changed to use SLF4J logger and parameterized logging
- `PlayerAreaListener.java`: Added SLF4J logger for area state tracking

### 2. PlayerAreaListener Logic Problems
**Issues**:
- The method returned a boolean but it was never used
- Had a `previousInside` map that was declared but never used
- Y-coordinate check was incorrect (checked entire world height instead of being relevant to range)
- No actual state tracking for enter/exit events
- No actions were triggered based on area entry/exit

**Solution**: Complete rewrite of PlayerAreaListener with:

#### Improved Distance Check
- Changed from square bounds to circular distance check (more accurate)
- Uses squared distance calculation for better performance (avoids sqrt)
- Removed the incorrect Y-coordinate check that checked entire world height

```java
// Old approach (square bounds with incorrect Y check)
return x >= minX && x <= maxX && z >= minZ && z <= maxZ && y >= minY && y <= maxY;

// New approach (circular distance)
double distanceSquared = dx * dx + dz * dz;
return distanceSquared <= rangeSquared;
```

#### State Tracking System
Added proper state tracking with:
- `AreaState` inner class to track player position state
- Tracking of previous state (was inside/outside)
- Detection of new laser locations
- `AreaCheckResult` class to communicate state changes

#### Event Detection
The new implementation can detect:
- When a player enters the sound range (`hasEntered()`)
- When a player leaves the sound range (`hasLeft()`)
- When there's a new laser location (`isNewLocation`)
- When state has changed (`hasStateChanged()`)

#### Debug Logging
Enhanced debug logging that shows:
- New laser locations
- Players entering the sound range
- Players leaving the sound range
- Player state when they remain in range

### 3. Integration with Main Server Logic

**Changes in OrbitalRailgunSounds.java**:

#### Enhanced SHOOT_PACKET_ID Handler
- Now checks **all players** on the server (not just the shooter)
- Calls `handlePlayerAreaCheck()` for each player
- Properly uses the returned `AreaCheckResult`

```java
// Check all players on the server to see if they're in range
server.getPlayerManager().getPlayerList().forEach(serverPlayer -> {
    PlayerAreaListener.AreaCheckResult result = 
        PlayerAreaListener.handlePlayerAreaCheck(serverPlayer, laserX, laserZ);
    
    // Handle area state changes for each player
    handleAreaStateChange(serverPlayer, result, laserX, laserZ);
});
```

#### New handleAreaStateChange() Method
Created a central method to handle area state changes:
- Detects when players enter the sound range
- Detects when players leave the sound range
- Detects when players remain in range
- Provides hooks for future sound start/stop implementation
- Includes TODO comments for implementing actual sound control

```java
private static void handleAreaStateChange(ServerPlayerEntity player, 
                                         PlayerAreaListener.AreaCheckResult result, 
                                         double laserX, double laserZ) {
    if (result.hasEntered()) {
        // Player just entered - start sounds
    } else if (result.hasLeft()) {
        // Player just left - stop sounds
    }
}
```

#### Player Disconnect Cleanup
Added event listener to clean up state when players disconnect:
```java
ServerPlayConnectionEvents.DISCONNECT.register((handler, server) -> {
    PlayerAreaListener.clearPlayerState(handler.getPlayer().getUuid());
});
```

This prevents memory leaks from accumulating state for disconnected players.

### 4. Enhanced AREA_CHECK_PACKET_ID Handler
- Now properly uses the return value from `handlePlayerAreaCheck()`
- Calls `handleAreaStateChange()` to process the result
- Reads packet data before executing on server thread (fixes potential race condition)

## API Changes

### PlayerAreaListener Public Methods

**New Methods**:
- `isPlayerInRange(ServerPlayerEntity, double, double)`: Check if player is in range
- `handlePlayerAreaCheck(ServerPlayerEntity, double, double)`: Check area and track state
- `clearPlayerState(UUID)`: Clear state for specific player
- `clearAllStates()`: Clear all player states

**Removed**: 
- Old `handlePlayerAreaCheck()` that returned unused boolean

### AreaCheckResult Class
New public class to communicate state information:
- `isInside`: Current state (in range or not)
- `wasInside`: Previous state
- `isNewLocation`: Whether this is a new laser location
- `hasEntered()`: Check if player just entered
- `hasLeft()`: Check if player just left
- `hasStateChanged()`: Check if state changed

## Testing Recommendations

### Enable Debug Mode
Use the command to enable debug mode:
```
/orsounds debug true
```

This will show:
- Initialization messages
- Shoot packet reception
- New laser locations
- Players entering/leaving sound range
- Player disconnect cleanup

### What to Test
1. **Single Player**:
   - Fire railgun and observe logs showing your position relative to impact
   - Move away from impact point and verify "left sound range" message
   - Move back and verify "entered sound range" message

2. **Multiplayer**:
   - Have one player fire the railgun
   - Check logs for all players on the server
   - Verify each player's state is tracked correctly
   - Test player disconnects and verify cleanup

3. **Multiple Shots**:
   - Fire at different locations
   - Verify "new laser location" messages
   - Verify state is properly reset for new locations

### Expected Log Output
With debug mode enabled, you should see logs like:
```
[INFO] Orbital Railgun Sounds Addon initialized. Sound events registered
[INFO] Received shoot packet from player: PlayerName at BlockPos: {x, y, z}
[INFO] New laser location: (x, z) for player PlayerName
[INFO] Player PlayerName entered sound range at (x, z)
[INFO] Player PlayerName left sound range at (x, z)
[INFO] Cleared area state for disconnected player: PlayerName
```

## Future Work

### Sound Control Implementation
The system now properly detects area entry/exit, but doesn't actually control sounds yet. To implement this:

1. Define packet identifiers for sound control:
   ```java
   public static final Identifier START_AMBIENT_SOUND_PACKET_ID = new Identifier(MOD_ID, "start_ambient");
   public static final Identifier STOP_AMBIENT_SOUND_PACKET_ID = new Identifier(MOD_ID, "stop_ambient");
   ```

2. In `handleAreaStateChange()`, send packets to clients:
   ```java
   if (result.hasEntered()) {
       // Send packet to start playing ambient railgun sounds
       ServerPlayNetworking.send(player, START_AMBIENT_SOUND_PACKET_ID, /* data */);
   } else if (result.hasLeft()) {
       // Send packet to stop playing ambient railgun sounds
       ServerPlayNetworking.send(player, STOP_AMBIENT_SOUND_PACKET_ID, /* data */);
   }
   ```

3. On the client side, register packet handlers to start/stop looping sounds

### Additional Improvements
- Add configurable cooldown for re-checking player positions
- Implement 3D distance (currently only checks X/Z for performance)
- Add visualization in debug mode (particles showing range boundary)
- Add metrics for area checks (average players in range, etc.)

## Notes

- The user mentioned they cannot build the project, so these changes have not been compiled/tested
- All changes follow Fabric/Minecraft modding best practices
- Used existing code style and patterns from the project
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing packet handlers
- Added comprehensive JavaDoc comments for maintainability
