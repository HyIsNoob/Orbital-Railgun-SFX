# Orbital Railgun – Sounds Addon

Client-side addon that adds custom sound effects to the [Orbital Railgun](https://modrinth.com/mod/orbital-railgun) mod. It introduces three core sounds—equip (draw), scope-on (start aiming), and fire (when the railgun actually shoots)
## Download (for players)

- Go to the GitHub Releases tab of this repo and download the latest `.jar` file.
- Link: <https://github.com/HyIsNoob/Orbital-Railgun-SFX/releases>

## How to Install

1) Make sure you’re on Minecraft 1.20.1 with Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed.
2) Install the original mod “Orbital Railgun” by Mishkis (required).
3) Drop this addon’s `.jar` into your `mods` folder.

This is client-side. You can join servers normally as long as your client has the original mod.

## Features

- Equip: plays when switching to the Orbital Railgun in your hotbar.
- Scope-on: plays when you begin aiming (hold right-click).
- Fire: plays when the railgun actually fires (at cooldown start), not simply on release.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.20.1
- Fabric Loader + Fabric API
- Original mod: Orbital Railgun by [Mishkis](https://modrinth.com/user/Mishkis)
  - Mod page: <https://modrinth.com/mod/orbital-railgun>

## Notes

- This addon does not change gameplay—only adds sound effects
- If you Alt-Tab, Minecraft will pause audio when unfocused while the animations is still going so it will be not sync anymore!
