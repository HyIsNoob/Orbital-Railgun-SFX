A lightweight client-side addon that adds custom sound effects to the [Orbital Railgun](https://modrinth.com/mod/orbital-railgun) mod. It introduces three core soundsâ€”equip (draw), scope-on (start aiming), and fire (when the railgun actually shoots)

## Features

- Equip: plays when switching to the Orbital Railgun in the hotbar.
- Scope-on: plays when you begin aiming (hold right-click).
- Fire: plays only when the railgun truly fires (at cooldown start), not simply on release.
- Customizable Settings: Adjust volume for each sound or enable/disable specific sound effects via the config menu (accessible through Mod Menu).
