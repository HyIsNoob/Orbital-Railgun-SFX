# Quick Reference Guide

## What Was Fixed

### âœ… Logger Issues
- **Problem**: Logs weren't appearing in console even with debug mode enabled
- **Fix**: Changed from `java.util.logging.Logger` to SLF4J (Minecraft's standard logger)
- **Result**: All logs now properly appear in server console

### âœ… PlayerAreaListener Logic
- **Problem**: Area check logic was incorrect and didn't track state changes
- **Fix**: 
  - Changed from square bounds to circular distance check (more accurate)
  - Removed incorrect Y-coordinate check that checked entire world height
  - Added proper state tracking for enter/exit events
  - Now tracks which players are in range of each laser impact
- **Result**: System correctly detects when players enter/leave sound range

### âœ… Integration with Server
- **Problem**: Area check results weren't being used
- **Fix**: 
  - SHOOT_PACKET now checks all players on server (not just shooter)
  - Added `handleAreaStateChange()` method to process enter/exit events
  - Added player disconnect cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Result**: System is ready to control sounds based on player position

## How to Test

### 1. Enable Debug Mode
Run this command in-game:
```
/orsounds debug true
```

### 2. Check Server Console
You should now see logs like:
```
[INFO] Orbital Railgun Sounds Addon initialized. Sound events registered
[INFO] Received shoot packet from player: YourName at BlockPos: {...}
[INFO] New laser location: (x, z) for player YourName
[INFO] Player YourName entered sound range at (x, z)
```

### 3. Test Movement
- Fire the railgun
- Walk away from the impact point (more than 500 blocks if using default range)
- You should see: `Player YourName left sound range`
- Walk back toward the impact point
- You should see: `Player YourName entered sound range`

### 4. Test Multiplayer
- Have multiple players on the server
- One player fires the railgun
- Check console - should see logs for all players indicating their state

### 5. Disable Debug Mode
When done testing:
```
/orsounds debug false
```

## What's Ready Now

âœ… **Working**:
- Logger outputs to console correctly
- Area tracking logic is correct (circular distance check)
- State tracking (knows when players enter/leave range)
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Player disconnect cleanup
- Multi-player support (checks all players)

ðŸš§ **Not Yet Implemented** (marked with TODO in code):
- Actually starting/stopping sounds based on area entry/exit
- This requires client-side packet handlers and looping sound logic
- See `handleAreaStateChange()` in `OrbitalRailgunSounds.java` for where to add this

## Commands Available

- `/orsounds debug true` - Enable debug logging
- `/orsounds debug false` - Disable debug logging  
- `/orsounds radius <value>` - Set sound range in blocks (default: 500)
- `/orsounds help` - Show command help

## Next Steps

If you want to implement actual sound control:

1. **Server Side** (in `handleAreaStateChange()`):
   - When player enters: Send packet to client to start looping sound
   - When player leaves: Send packet to client to stop looping sound

2. **Client Side**:
   - Register packet handlers for start/stop commands
   - Implement looping sound playback
   - Handle sound stopping when player leaves range

The infrastructure is now in place to support this functionality.

## Files Modified

1. **OrbitalRailgunSounds.java**
   - Fixed logger
   - Added `handleAreaStateChange()` method
   - Added player disconnect cleanup
   - Enhanced SHOOT_PACKET handler to check all players

2. **PlayerAreaListener.java**
   - Complete rewrite with proper state tracking
   - Changed to circular distance check
   - Added `AreaCheckResult` class
   - Added debug logging

3. **SoundLogger.java**
   - Fixed to use SLF4J logger
   - Improved log formatting

## Troubleshooting

**If you don't see logs**:
- Make sure debug mode is enabled: `/orsounds debug true`
- Check that the config file has `"debugMode": true`
- Config location: `config/orbital-railgun-sounds-server-config.json`

**If area detection seems wrong**:
- Check the configured sound range: `/orsounds radius`
- Distance is calculated in 2D (X and Z only, ignoring Y)
- Default range is 500 blocks

**If player states aren't clearing**:
- This should happen automatically on disconnect
- If needed, restart the server to clear all states
