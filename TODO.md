# TODO

## Dynamic Sound Effects

- [ ] Add reverb or echo effects for railgun sounds in specific environments (e.g., caves, open fields, underwater).
- [x] Implement directional sounds to make the sound louder or quieter based on the player's position relative to the firing location.

## Customizable Sound Settings

- [x] Add a config file to adjust the volume of individual sounds (e.g., scope-on, railgun shoot).
- [x] Allow players to enable or disable specific sound effects.

## Multiplayer Enhancements

- [ ] Implement positional audio for multiplayer, so players hear the railgun firing from the correct direction and distance.

## Compatibility with Other Mods

- [x] Add compatibility with **Dynamic Surroundings** or **Sound Physics Remastered** to enhance the audio experience.

## Debugging or Testing Features

- [x] Add a debug mode that logs sound events to the console for testing sound propagation and range.
